# LD 17: Islands (codename Envasive)
-------------

## Progress log

20100423 22:20:09 - Have applet publishing and the SVG pipeline works great, but no real solid ideas so far. Not too bad a base to build on tomorrow, though. TIME 4 SLEEP!

20100424 10:36:22 - Sick. Slept a bunch, terrifying poops. Not going to worry TOO much about finishing this thing, but going to try to at least go for my tree-killing virus-spreading two-sided story concept.
