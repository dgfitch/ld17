# LD 17: Islands (codename Envasive)
-------------

## Progress log

20100423 22:20:09 - Have applet publishing and the SVG pipeline works great, but no real solid ideas so far. Not too bad a base to build on tomorrow, though. TIME 4 SLEEP!

20100424 10:36:22 - Sick. Slept a bunch, terrifying poops. Not going to worry TOO much about finishing this thing, but going to try to at least go for my tree-killing virus-spreading two-sided story concept.

20100424 16:25:53 - No more time really invested so far today. Went to lunch with a friend, working out the sickness and playing some games. Getting out of the house now some, going to coffee shop it up and switch tracks to a different idea before getting too far at all on the first one, which was a bit too complicated for a 48 hour attempt where I've already spent half a day on other things.

20100424 16:39:19 - Wow, the compositing and blending stuff in Pulpcore is pretty awesome. 10 minutes and the first "flashlight" or "helicopter spotlight" fx are working.

20100424 16:44:07 - Crap, I don't know how to mask layers with Inkscape. Might be harder to do the cones if I can't get alpha masks.
